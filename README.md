# SSE Hooks

API for hooking upon SSE's sub-system, Papyrus API and maybe other functions.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x for the build system (2.x may work too)
* C++14 compatible compiler available on the PATH

## Configuration

SSEH is using JSON formatted configuration structure. This allows flexible management, but working
with it requires certain schema to comply to.

An example of configuration:

```json
{

}
```
